CryptoBot
Project Overview
This repository outlines the development of a cryptocurrency trading bot. The project leverages various technologies to handle data, process it in real-time, and deploy the solution effectively. The objective is to build a sophisticated trading system that uses Machine Learning for decision-making in the cryptocurrency market.

Project Steps

Step 1 / Data Discovery
Objective: Define the project scope and gather data from various sources such as APIs and web pages.
Technologies Used: Python for data collection
Deliverable: A report detailing the different data sources and examples of the collected data.

Step 2 / Data Organization
Objective: Structure and organize data using SQL databases. Utilize Kafka for data ingestion and Spark Streaming for processing.
Technologies Used: Kafka for data ingestion, Spark Streaming for processing data in real-time, SQL databases (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) for structured data management.
Deliverable: Documentation of the data architecture, including a UML diagram.

Step 3 / Data Consumption
Objective: Develop and train Machine Learning models to utilize the organized data and address trading challenges.
Technologies Used: Machine Learning for model development.
Deliverable: A Machine Learning model that processes data and provides trading recommendations.

Step 4 / Deployment
Objective: Develop APIs to serve the Machine Learning model. Containerize the API and the application using Docker. Monitor system performance.
Technologies Used: FastAPI and Flask for API development, Docker for containerization, Grafana for performance monitoring.
Deliverable: A deployed API with Docker containers, unit tests, and monitoring setup.

Step 5 / Automation & Monitoring
Objective: Automate data processing and model updates. Set up scheduling and orchestration for data tasks using Airflow and Crontab. Monitor the application in production.
Technologies Used: Airflow and Crontab for scheduling and automating tasks, Kafka and Spark Streaming for data processing, Grafana for monitoring.
Deliverable: Automated workflows with Airflow and Crontab, CI/CD integration, and monitoring solutions.
Step 6 / Application Demonstration & Presentation
Objective: Present the project, explain the data architecture, and demonstrate that the application is functional. Detailed discussion on data consumption is not required.
Deliverable: A 20-minute presentation and a 10-minute Q&A session, showcasing the project's functionality and architecture.


Technologies Used
Kafka: For managing high-throughput data streams.
Spark Streaming: For real-time data processing and analytics.
SQL: For structured data storage and querying.
Machine Learning: For predictive modeling and trading strategies.
FastAPI & Flask: For API development and serving model predictions.
Docker: For containerizing the application to ensure consistent deployment.
Grafana: For monitoring and visualizing system performance.
